Overview:


Waptech Agri-Connect is a digital platform aimed at providing comprehensive agricultural extension services to farmers in Kenya. The project leverages web technology and data-driven solutions to address key challenges faced by farmers, such as limited access to agricultural information, inadequate support for farming practices, and lack of market connections.

Farmer-to-Farmer Knowledge Sharing: 

Implement a peer-to-peer knowledge sharing feature within the web application, enabling farmers to connect with each other, share experiences, and seek advice. This social network component will foster a sense of community and enable farmers to learn from one another.

Market Linkage:

Integrate a feature that connects farmers to potential buyers, including local markets, retailers, and exporters. This will help farmers access better market opportunities, negotiate fair prices, and improve their income potential.

Data Analytics: 

Collect and analyze data from farmers using the platform to gain insights into farming trends, challenges, and success stories. This information can be used to improve the platform's offerings, tailor agricultural recommendations, and provide customized support to individual farmers.

Training and Capacity Building: 

Organize training sessions and documentations to enhance farmers' digital literacy and empower them to effectively use the Waplink Agri-Connect platform. Collaborate with agricultural experts and organizations to deliver training on topics such as sustainable farming techniques, financial management, and market intelligence.
